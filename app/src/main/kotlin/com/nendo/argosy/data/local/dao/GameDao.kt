 * Hiding is per account and lives in `user_roms_hidden`, so every list, count and filter here
 * carries the owner it is being run for and tests row existence rather than a column.
 *
 * A row with a null owner is an unattributed hide from an install that predates accounts, and
 * counts for whoever is signed in; the alternative is a user's hidden roms all reappearing the
 * first time they sign in to RomM. `save_cache` reads its unattributed rows the same way.
